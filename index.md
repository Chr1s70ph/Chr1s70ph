# Welcome to my page

I am a developer in my freetime. I study Electical-Engineering at KIT-Karlsruhe in Germany.

## About me

I started coding when I was 12 years old. Back then, it was mostly just websites. Since November 2020 I started developing [ETIT-Master](https://github.com/Chr1s70ph/ETIT-Master), a personal Discord-Bot. 

## Languages

I began coding using JavaScript, moved on to C# in 2018 and got back to Node.js in 2020. Ever since I have been learning about Node.js/JavaScript and most recently TypeScript. Also I started helping a Project called [QuickKey](https://github.com/leokraft/QuickKey). A small Windows application to quickly find special characters and copy them to your clipboard in an instant, written in C++.
